EP-INV-feedback
==============
Basic prototype for providing feedback regarding name-attributions.

Background
----------
The APE‐INV programme ([http://www.academicpatenting.eu][ape]) is a Database 
Harmonization project sponsored by the European Science Foundation (ESF). 
It aims at collecting cross‐country data on European universities’ contribution
to patented inventions by re‐classifying patents by inventors, and by 
discovering whether such inventors belong to the academic research system. 
The reference source of raw patent data is the PatStat database, issued for 
statistical purposes by the European Patent Office (EPO). A very important 
intermediate objective of APE‐INV consists in creating an inventors’ database.
The creation and maintenance of the inventors' database requires devising a 
method for collecting the database users’ feedbacks on the quality of the data, one that will allow users to enter their own corrections to the identification 
errors. 

Usage
-----
In [R][]:

   > source("bicocca.R")
